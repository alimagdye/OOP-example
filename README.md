Readable and Concise: The method chaining makes the operations easy to follow, almost like reading a mathematical expression.
Encapsulation: By using a private #result, you ensure the internal state isn't accessible or modifiable from outside the class.
Extendable.
Error Handling: Division by zero is caught in the divide() method.
    Taking the square root of a negative number throws an error in the sqrt() method.
